      Sneyd's previous website had served them well, but they were struggling to
      gain ground against competitors across search rankings and were looking
      for a way to boost website sales.

      I worked with Sneyd's to produce a brand new ecommerce website designed
      and built from the ground up on the robust combination of WordPress and
      Woocommerce.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      To address Sneyd's desire to rank higher across search engines, I helped
      with a range of SEO services, such as copy and content optimisation,
      landing pages, and SEO best-practices. This work delivered a <strong
        >65% boost in organic traffic</strong
      >, which helped power further sales.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      The website is very customer-centric, making it easy for visitors to find
      exactly what they're looking for via clear signalling, strong calls to
      action, and defined purchase pathways.
