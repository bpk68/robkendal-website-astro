      Ashes With Art hand-craft made-to-order jewellery pieces that incorporate the ashes of loved ones to make truly memorable gifts. We supported their SEO consultancy work to improve the speed of their Shopify store across mobile devices, and developed custom landing pages to maximise conversions.

      I worked closely with the Ashes With Art team in collaboration with an SEO consultancy to make several site-wide changes and optimisations to their custom-built Shopify store. This helped to improve their website speed, especially on mobile devices, which ultimately helped to increase their search result rankings.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Along with several tweaks and changes across the site, we also developed several custom landing pages in keeping with their current theme design, to further maximise Ashes With Artâ€™s conversions from visitors to their collection pages.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Finally, we helped to upgrade their current theme to take advantage of the latest Shopify features, and successfully launched their shiny new and improved Shopify store
