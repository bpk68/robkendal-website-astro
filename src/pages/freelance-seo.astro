                recommendations from a content perspective to send them in the right direction from that perspective

                For example, we could include a technical review of the site from a performance point of view (it’s touches on in the bullets you shared),  
                Accessibility audit
                UX/CRO assessment and recommendations — e.g. it’s no good getting more traffic if you’re not converting or your user journey is pants.

                would have a written up content calendar ready to go). The only thing they would need to action
