# Rob Kendal website

This is my personal website built using modern static site practices and using the following tech stack:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- TypeScript
- [Tina CMS](https://app.tina.io)
- Extended markdown with [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev)
- PNPM package manager

Huge shout out to the [Blogster bubblegum template](https://blogster-bubblegum.netlify.app) on which this site is based. As a newcomer to the Astro framework, the bugglebum template helped give me a great starting point on which to build.
