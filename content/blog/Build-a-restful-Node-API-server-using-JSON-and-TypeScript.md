A while ago I wrote a popular article on [how to build a RESTful Node API server.](/blog/how-to-build-a-restful-node-js-api-server-using-json-files) This and it's [accompanying GitHub repo](https://github.com/bpk68/api-server-starter), went down well and even became part of the curriculum in a US university course!

However, times and technology move on. After revisiting the repo and the code, I decided to revamp and rewrite from scratch, this time using not only the latest version of Express, but using a slightly different architecture and structure in the form of the controller and routes pattern. Also, for you TypeScript fans out there the new and updated version is fully type aware and is written entirely in TypeScript. Good times!

You can check out the [Node API starter kit with TypeScript on GitHub](https://github.com/bpk68/api-server-starter-ts), but for now, let's dive in!

## 1. Node API project setup

## 2. Building the new `server.ts` file

## 3. Mapping the routes

## 4. Creating our controller

## 5. Testing the API server

## 6. Extending the API server with CRUD

## Enjoy your fully functional Node-based API server

There's lots more you could add to extend this, such as authentication handling, talking to a database, different routes, and so on. As it stands, we've got a fully functional API server base that will happily serve you some information from a JSON file store. 

You can [visit the GitHub repository for the starter API server](https://github.com/bpk68/api-server-starter-ts) to download, checkout or fork to your heart's content.
